Orca is meant to be a structured pattern for writing macros in multiple "layers" or "passes".
These layers are part of a triangular hierarchy.

Or can we try to generalize it. Like you can let the users set up their layers of macros?

Lets try one with only 2 layers first. Python CLASS and Python LIBRARY.
